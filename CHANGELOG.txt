Added
- "Customer Self-care Portal Login Source" option in the wizard;
Modified
- account login is now equal to an account number by default;
- customer name is now 'firstname lastname' by default;
- if "Customer Self-care Portal Login Source" is set to email_rand_digits, the customer name will be equal to the login 
(e.g, happym@domain.com_8989 will be both name and login, designed for tests to prevent the duplicate customer name/login in the environment error);
- 'add_package' function in the wizard.js to make it more readable.
